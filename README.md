A full stack web application using python & django for the backend and javascript & react for the frontend. 
Already done: 
- I've used django rest framework to implement a django REST API and setup some endpoints to use later in our project.
- I've used webpack and babel to bundle the react app and have the django backend render a template that react will control.

Actually learning: how to user react router, perform page redirects and use the history prop involved with react router.
